### Adding New Cache Types

When adding support for new applications or cache types:

1. **Research First**: Ensure the cache is safe to delete
2. **Add to Safe Patterns**: Update the appropriate cache pattern lists
3. **Test Extensively**: Verify the application works after cache deletion
4. **Update Documentation**: Add the new cache type to README.md

### Code Structure

- `InteractiveUI`: Handles arrow-key navigation and real-time deletion
- `CacheCleaner`: Main logic for cache detection and deletion
- Safety checks are distributed throughout both classes
