A powerful, safe, and user-friendly utility to identify and clean large cache directories from your Mac. Features both interactive arrow-key navigation and classic selection modes.

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ **Interactive UI**: Navigate with arrow keys, delete with DELETE key  
‚úÖ **Classic Mode**: Traditional numbered selection interface  
‚úÖ **Safe Operation**: Automatically protects system-critical directories  
‚úÖ **Smart Detection**: Finds caches ‚â• 100MB across system and projects  
‚úÖ **Project Cleanup**: Safely removes old build artifacts (node_modules, Rust targets - 1+ day old)  
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: See space freed immediately in interactive mode  
‚úÖ **Full Path Display**: Verify exactly what will be deleted  
‚úÖ **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library  

## What It Cleans

**System & App Caches:**
- Application caches (`~/Library/Caches/*`)
- Browser caches (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera)
- Application support caches
- System logs (`~/Library/Logs/*`)
- Container and sandbox caches
- WebKit local storage caches

**3rd Party Applications:**
- Unity Hub & Editor caches
- Chrome/Chromium (GPU, Shader, Application caches)
- VS Code (workspace storage, extensions, logs)
- Slack, Discord, Spotify caches
- Adobe application caches (media cache files)
- JetBrains IDEs (system caches, temp files)
- Docker, Figma caches

**Development Tools:**
- npm global cache (`~/.npm`) and `_cacache`
- Homebrew cache (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- Yarn, pip, Composer caches
- CocoaPods, Gradle, Maven caches
- Rust Cargo, Go module caches

**Project Dependencies:**
- `node_modules` directories in Node.js projects
- `target` directories in Rust projects (compilation artifacts)
- **Safety**: Only targets build directories that haven't been modified in 1+ days
- **Smart Detection**: Verifies projects by checking for `package.json` / `Cargo.toml`
- Scans common development folders: `~/Development`, `~/Projects`, `~/Code`, `~/Desktop`, etc.

## What It Protects

The cleaner automatically avoids these system-critical areas:
- Keychains and Preferences
- System frameworks and services
- Apple system components
- Login and security services
- Audio, fonts, and system resources

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on macOS 10.14+)
- Python 3.6 or later
- No external dependencies required

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Mac_Cleaner.git
cd Mac_Cleaner

# Make the script executable
chmod +x mac_cache_cleaner.py

# Run the cleaner
python3 mac_cache_cleaner.py
```

### Alternative: Direct Download

1. Download `mac_cache_cleaner.py` from this repository
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x mac_cache_cleaner.py`
3. Run: `python3 mac_cache_cleaner.py`

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Interface Modes

The cleaner offers two interface modes:

#### 1. üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Mode (Recommended)
Navigate with arrow keys and delete items instantly:

```bash
python3 mac_cache_cleaner.py
# Choose option 1 for Interactive Mode
```

**Controls:**
- `‚Üë/‚Üì` Arrow keys to navigate
- `DELETE` or `D` key to remove selected item
- `ENTER` to view detailed information
- `ESC` or `Q` to quit

#### 2. üìù Classic Mode
Traditional numbered selection:

```bash
python3 mac_cache_cleaner.py
# Choose option 2 for Classic Mode
```

**Process:**
1. **Scanning**: Scans for cache directories ‚â• 100MB
2. **Selection**: Choose directories using numbers (e.g., `1 3 5` or `all`)
3. **Confirmation**: Type `DELETE` to confirm batch deletion

### Example Session

```
üßπ macOS Cache Cleaner
==================================================
üîç Scanning ~/Library/ for cache directories...
   Looking for directories >= 100MB

üìä Found 3 cache directories >= 100MB:
================================================================================
 1. Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome
    Size: 245.3MB

 2. Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/abc123/cache2
    Size: 156.7MB

 3. Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports
    Size: 123.4MB

üíæ Total cache size: 525.4MB
================================================================================

üóëÔ∏è  Select directories to delete:
   Enter numbers separated by spaces (e.g., '1 3 5')
   Enter 'all' to select all directories
   Enter 'quit' or 'q' to exit without deleting

Your selection: 1 2

‚ö†Ô∏è  FINAL CONFIRMATION
   You are about to permanently delete 2 directories
   Total size: 402.0MB

üìÅ Directories to delete:
   ‚Ä¢ Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome (245.3MB)
   ‚Ä¢ Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/abc123/cache2 (156.7MB)

üö® THIS ACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE!

Type 'DELETE' (in capitals) to proceed, or anything else to cancel: DELETE

üóëÔ∏è  Deleting 2 directories...
   Deleting Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome... ‚úÖ Done
   Deleting Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/abc123/cache2... ‚úÖ Done

üìä Deletion Summary:
   ‚úÖ Successfully deleted: 2 directories (402.0MB)

‚ú® Cache cleaning completed!
```

## Safety Features

- **Whitelist-based scanning**: Only scans known safe cache locations
- **System protection**: Hardcoded blacklist of critical system directories
- **Manual confirmation**: Requires explicit user action for each deletion
- **No system files**: Cannot access or modify system-level directories
- **Time-based protection**: Build directories (`node_modules`, `target`) must be 1+ days old to be considered for deletion
- **Conservative approach**: When in doubt, the cleaner won't delete
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles permission errors and missing files

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors
Some directories may require elevated permissions. The cleaner will skip these and continue safely.

### No Cache Found
If no large cache directories are found, your system is already clean!

### Interrupted Process
Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to safely exit without making changes.
